                The purpose of the Baha'i Association is to foster relationships with like-minded groups and individuals who are interested in benefiting the University of Florida as well as society. We hope to instill a sense of unity that overcomes cultural, religious, and ideological barriers. Members of the Baha'i Association believe the best way to better themselves is by service to other members of the community.
