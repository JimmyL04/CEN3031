                Our Student Ambassadors serve as the “face” of the College and work closely with college faculty, staff, the community, alumni, and prospective students. The Student Ambassador Program is not only a service organization, but also provides a leadership opportunity for students. Student Ambassadors lead campus tours, assist in hosting major college events, and serve as representatives of the college within the local community. Student involvement is essential to our efforts in telling the complete story...
