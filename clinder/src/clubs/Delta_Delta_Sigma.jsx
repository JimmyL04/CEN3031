                The mission of Delta Delta Sigma is to introduce students to the dental profession and provide a helpful environment for success in their pre-dental academics. The academic road to dental school is very difficult. Delta Delta Sigma's goal is to make that journey as attainable and easy as possible. By building a community of students with similar interests, we can work together and all achieve our goals by serving the community and inspiring altruism.
