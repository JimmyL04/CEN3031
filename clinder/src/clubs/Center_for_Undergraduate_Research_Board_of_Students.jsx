                The mission of the Center for Undergraduate Research Board of Students (CURBS) is to help undergraduates become more involved in the research process and to improve the student research experience in existing undergraduate programs. Through workshops, lectures, networking events, and peer advising, we hope to foster an accessible educational environment in the undergraduate research community. We also hope to promote undergraduate research by creating awareness of the multitude of opportunities available to students, as well...
