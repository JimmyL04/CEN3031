                Argentine Tango Club consists of students, faculty and staff from the University of Florida and community members from Gainesville. The purpose of the club is to provide a venue within the campus for learning, practicing, and enjoying the Argentine Tango. Our group is a non-profit student-run organization and we offer free lessons for UF students. We also perform at local dance shows and fund-raising activities.
