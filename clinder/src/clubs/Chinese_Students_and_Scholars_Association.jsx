                The purpose of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) is to help Chinese people integrate into the University of Florida and Gainesville community and find their place there. We wish to promote Chinese culture to UF students and to raise the awareness of American culture to Chinese students and scholars through general body meetings, language corner, traditional cultural holiday events and other activities. CSSA also aims to provide more networking opportunities for Chinese students...
