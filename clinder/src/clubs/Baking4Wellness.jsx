                Baking 4 Wellness is an organization that promotes mental and general health awareness to the community through the art of baking. Members will have the opportunity to learn the basics of baking and apply that knowledge via fundraising and philanthropy. Members will be able to participate through workshops, general body meetings, social events, and more. We would also like to teach students how to incorporate fruits and vegetables into baking to promote general wellness. Workshops...
