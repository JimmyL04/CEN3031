                We are an organization that strives to be the exemplary model of justice, sisterhood, and love. We support each other in our internal successes as well as our external endeavors throughout campus. We focus on giving back to the community, Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANA D) and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation specifically, through various philanthropic events and fundraisers. Our everlasting motto is "esse quam videri"--to be, rather than to seem to be; we pride ourselves...
